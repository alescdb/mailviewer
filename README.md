# MailViewer

MailViewer is a GNOME application that allows users to read and decode `.eml` and `.msg` files (email files) without having to install any additional software or create an account.

It provides a graphical interface for easy navigation and rendering of email content, including attachments, HTML, and plain text.

Written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) with [GTK4](https://www.gtk.org/)/[libadwaita](https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libadwaita/doc/main/index.html)

## Features

- **Open and view `.eml` or `.msg` files**: Display the email's subject, sender, receiver, and content.
- **Decode email attachments**: View and/or save attachments.
- **Support for HTML and plain text emails**: Render emails in both formats (if available).

## Q&A

### I can't access files outside of `$HOME` or on an USB stick

This is a flatpak/sandbox issue, you can grant it access to the `host` filesystem with the following command:

```bash
flatpak override --user --filesystem=host io.github.alescdb.mailviewer
```

If you also need access to files on a USB stick, use this command:

```bash
flatpak override --user --device=all io.github.alescdb.mailviewer
```

Alternatively, you can install [Flatseal](https://flathub.org/apps/com.github.tchx84.Flatseal) to adjust permissions.

```
flatpak install --user io.github.alescdb.mailviewer
```

##### Flatpak Permissions

- Network : for fetching remote images (if the Show Images is checked, false by default), safe to disable if you don't wan't to see remote images.
- xdg-run/mailviewer (`/run/user/<uid>/mailviewer`) : for extracting attachments and opening it with associated program.
- home:rw : reading eml file and saving attachments.
